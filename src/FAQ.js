        <h3>What types of switches are available for mechanical keyboards?</h3>
        <p>Mechanical switches are generally classified into three types: clicky switches (such as Cherry MX Blue), linear switches (such as Cherry MX Red), and tactile switches (such as Cherry MX Brown). Each type provides a different typing experience in terms of tactile feedback and sound.</p>
